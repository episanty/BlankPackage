BlankPackage: a Mathematica package template 
====

This notebook is a template to start Mathematica packages. 


How to use
----------
To use, basically, replace "BlankPackage" with your package name (and any descriptions with the descriptions for your package) on all the relevant places:
 - Most importantly, open the notebook file, BlankPackage.nb, on a text editor, and search-and-replace the string 'BlankPackage' for your chosen package name.
 - Update the package description and homepage on the initialization cell at the end of the Readme section of the notebook file, which prints out a brief description onto the .m package (after which you can collapse the cell and forget about it).
 - Update the headers on File > Printing Settings > Headers and Footers.
 - Update the Readme cell with your own package description.
 - Update the Licensing section below with your chosen license.
 - Start writing! This is probably best done where the SampleFunction definition is.


Features
--------
After all that, you will have created a notebook master from which Mathematica will automatically create a package .m file every time you save the notebook. Why use this template?
 - The package privacy options have been set correctly: the Track Notebook History option has been turned off (ensuring that this notebook file can play reasonably well with source-control software), and FileOutlineCache has been set to False.
 - You get a number of handy commands for dealing with the package infrastructure, including a version number that includes the timestamp at which the notebook file was last saved, and an interface with git.
